NeXpy: A Python GUI to analyze NeXus data
=========================================

NeXpy provides a high-level python interface to `NeXus data 
<http://www.nexusformat.org/>`_ contained within a simple GUI. It is designed to 
provide an intuitive interactive toolbox allowing users both to access existing 
NeXus files and to create new NeXus-conforming data structures without expert 
knowledge of the file format.

.. note:: NeXpy v0.1.4 is now available for `download 
          <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/NeXpy/>`_. This is a beta-release so 
          please post any issues that you encounter on the `NeXpy GitHub 
          <https://github.com/nexpy/nexpy/issues>`_.
