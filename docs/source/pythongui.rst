*******************************
Python Graphical User Interface
*******************************
A PyQT GUI has been created to make it easier to keep track of the
loaded NeXus files and the results of any subsequent analysis. It is
invoked from the command line by::

 > nexpy

.. note:: This assumes that the Python 'bin' directory is in your standard shell
          path.

.. image:: /images/nexpy-gui.png
   :align: center
   :width: 90%

The illustration shows the main features of the GUI:

**1) Tree Pane**
    This contains the tree structure of NeXus or HDF5 files opened in
    the File menu, non-NeXus files that have been imported and converted
    into the NeXus format using one of the NeXus readers, and NXroot,
    NXentry, or NXdata groups added from the shell. Various actions on
    the data can be performed by right-clicking a tree item, include
    plotting, renaming, fitting and deleting the data.

**2) Plot Pane**
    This contains plots produced by (a) the Data\:Plot Data menu item,
    which operates on the NeXus data selected in the tree, (b)
    double-clicking on NeXus data in the tree, or (c) using NeXus data
    ``plot`` methods from the shell. If an NXdata, NXmonitor, or NXlog
    group is plotted, the rank, dimensions, and plotting axes are
    determined automatically. If the rank of the data is greater than
    two, a two-dimensional slice is extracted from the data. The GUI
    allows the selection of alternative slices using one of the axis
    panels (see below). If an NXfield is selected, the axes can be
    chosen from other NXfields in the same group. It is possible to open
    other plot windows and switch between them using the Window menu or
    keyboard shortcuts (see below).

**3) Shell Pane**
    This is an IPython shell, with NeXpy already imported (as * so no
    prefixes are necessary), along with NumPy (as 'np'), Pyplot (as
    'plt'), and Matplotlib (as 'mpl'). Any assignments to items in the
    tree pane are automatically reflected in the tree pane, and new
    NXroot or NXentry objects can be added to the tree from the IPython
    shell. NeXus data plots commands from the shell will appear in the
    plot pane, and Matplotlib commands can be used to modify the plot
    characteristics. The shell has enhanced features such as
    autocompletion of NeXus dictionaries and attributes and tooltips
    containing module docstrings when you open the module parentheses.

**4) Axis Panels**
    The tabbed panels below the plot can be used to modify the plots.
    The number of panels depends on the rank of the original data. The
    'signal', 'x' and 'y' panels have text boxes and sliders for
    adjusting the plotting limits. For rank two or more, a projection
    panel allows the plotting of projections along different directions,
    using the current axis limits. For ranks greater than two, a 'z'
    panel allows the other dimensions to be varied. Finally, the
    'options' panel provides access to the a number of tools for
    modifying the plot and saving/exporting the plotted data.

**5) Status Bar**
    The values and attributes of the currently selected item in the tree
    are displayed in the status bar.

**6) Tooltips**
    The NeXus tree structure of an item in the tree pane will be
    displayed as a tooltip when the cursor hovers over it.

NeXpy Menu Bar
--------------
File Menu
^^^^^^^^^
**New...**
    Creates a new workspace in the tree.

**Open...**
    Opens a new NeXus file as read-only. It is possible unlock the file
    to allow modifications to the file (see below).

    .. note:: It is possible to open a file in directly read/write mode
              using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+O (⌘+⇧+O on a
              Mac). Note that any changes to the file tree, using
              either the shell or GUI commands, will be automatically
              updated in the file.

**Open Recent...**
    Allows one of the 20 most recently opened or saved files to be
    opened. Hovering over one of the files in the list shows its
    absolute path.

**Open Image...**
    Opens an image file and imports the image and any stored metadata
    into an NXdata group within a root tree item, called ``images``.
    This will read TIFF and CBF files if `FabIO
    <https://pythonhosted.org/fabio/>`__ is installed. JPEG, PNG, and
    GIF files are imported using `Pillow
    <https://pillow.readthedocs.io/>`__. RGB(A) images contain
    three-dimensional arrays, including color (and transparency) layers,
    which can be displayed as two-dimensional images, with the y-axis
    inverted according to the usual image convention, using ``Plot
    RGB(A) Image``.

**Open Directory...**
    Opens all the HDF5 files stored in the selected directory. It does
    not reopen files already loaded into the tree.

**Save as...**
    Saves the selected tree item to a new NeXus file.

**Duplicate...**
    Makes a copy of the selected item, leaving the original untouched.
    If any field in the original tree is too large to be stored in
    memory, its data is stored in an HDF5 core memory file until the
    tree is saved to a file.

**Restore Session**
    Loads all the files that were open at the end of the previous NeXpy
    session.

    .. note:: When launching NeXpy, files from the previous session can
              be opened using the ``-r`` switch.

**Reload**
    Reloads the NeXus file. This is useful if another application has
    modified the data since originally opening the file.

    .. note:: If an external process has modified the currently loaded
              file, the lock icon color is changed to red. If the file
              was previously unlocked, its mode is automatically
              changed to read-only when the modification is detected.

**Reload All**
    Reloads all open NeXus files that have been modified by extermal processes.

**Remove**
    Removes the root item from the NeXpy tree.

    .. warning:: This will also remove the item with the same name from
                 the shell. However, if it had previously been assigned
                 to another variable with a different name, that
                 variable will not be deleted.

**Remove All**
    Removes all items from the NeXpy tree.

**Collapse Tree**
    Collapses all expanded items in the tree.

**Import**
    Imports data from other formats. Some importers are provided with
    the NeXpy distribution, but others will be loaded from the user's
    ``~/.nexpy/readers`` directory.

    .. seealso:: `Importing NeXus Data`_

**Export**
    Exports data to a NeXus file or, for one-dimensional data, to a
    multi-column ASCII file.

**Lock File**
    Changes the file access mode to read-only. This will prevent further
    changes to the tree using either the GUI or the shell. Locked files
    are displayed with a padlock icon.

**Unlock File**
    Changes the file access mode to read/write. If the root tree item
    has been saved to a file, any subsequent changes will automatically
    update the file, including deleting items.

    .. warning:: Any changes to an unlocked file will be immediate and
                 irreversible. If the file contains critical data,
                 click the checkbox to create a backup, which can be
                 restored later if necessary.

**Show File Locks**
    If a Lock Directory has been defined, this shows a listing of all
    files, whose access is blocked by a current lock file.

    .. seealso:: :ref:`File Locking`

**Backup File**
    Creates a backup of the selected file. The backup is stored in the
    user's home directory in ``~/.nexpy/backups`` and may be restored if
    changes to the currently open file need to be reversed. Backups are
    saved for five days before being automatically deleted.

**Restore Backup...**
    Restores the backup of this file. The user is prompted to confirm
    that the currently open file should be overwritten.

    .. note:: This only applies to backups created during the current
              session. Previously saved backups can be restored using
              the ``Manage Backups`` menu item.

**Manage Backups...**
    Provides the ability to restore or delete an existing backup stored
    in ``~/.nexpy/backups``. Restoring the backup is equivalent to
    opening the existing backup file. It is necessary to save it to a
    new location to prevent its automatic deletion after five days.

**Open Scratch File...**
    Saved projections and fits are stored in a scratch file called
    ``w0.nxs``, which is stored in the user's NeXpy directory,
    ``~/.nexpy``. This file is automatically opened when new data is
    saved, but this menu item allows it to be opened at any time.

**Purge Scratch File...**
    Previously saved items can be manually removed from the scratch file
    when they are no longer needed. This menu item purges all the items
    in one go.

**Close Scratch File...**
    Closes the scratch file.

**Manage Plugins**
    This opens a dialog, in which plugins that have been discovered
    within the Python distribution can be enabled or disabled. The order
    of the plugins in the menu bar can also be changed.

    .. seealso:: `NeXpy Plugins`_

**Edit Settings**
    Open a dialog to modify settings for this session. It is also
    possible to save them as the default for subsequent sessions.

Data Menu
^^^^^^^^^
**Plot Data**
    Plots the selected tree item in the plotting pane. If the selected
    item is not a valid NXdata, NXmonitor, or NXlog group, a plot dialog
    allows the user to specify axes with compatible dimensions to plot
    the data against.

**Overplot Data**
    Overplots the selected tree item in the plotting pane. This only
    works on one-dimensional data.

    .. note:: The new plot is overlaid on the original plot using the
              same axis limits. If some of the new data lies outside
              the original plotting limits, the slider limits are
              increased to cover the expanded range.

**Plot RGB(A) Image**
    Plots the selected tree item as an RGB(A) image. In such images, the
    fastest varying dimension, which should be of size 3 or 4, contains
    the RGB(A) values for each pixel. By convention, the first pixel is
    in the upper-left corner, rather than the lower-left.

**View Data**
    Provides a tabular view of the selected item, whether it is a group
    or a field. All the metadata associated with the item, including any
    attributes, are displayed. For multidimensional data, a 10 x 10 slab
    of values is displayed, with spin boxes to select the slab offsets.

**Validate Data**
    Displays a text window, in which the contents of the selected group
    are checked against the NeXus standard. There are options to check
    that the group contents conform to the base class or, in the case of
    NXentry, NXsubentry, and NXroot groups, to validate the group
    contents against an application definition. The definitions are, by
    default, stored in the installed package, but it is possible to
    select a different definitions directory, as well as a different
    application definition file. The XML definition of the group's base
    class can also be displayed.

    .. image:: /images/validation-panel.png
       :align: center
       :width: 90%

.. note:: Group validation is only available in NeXpy v2.0.0.

**Add Data**
    Adds data to the selected tree item. If the selected item is a
    group, the added data can be a group or field. If the selected item
    is a field, the added data must be a field attribute.

    When adding a field, the 'Add Data' dialog allows the name, value
    and data type to be specified. A dropdown menu can be used to enter
    field names that are defined by the NeXus standard, but the user is
    free to enter alternative names. The value field can be any valid
    Python expression, including NumPy functions such as np.linspace().

    When adding a group, the 'Add Data' dialog allows the name and class
    of the group to be specified. A dropdown menu display can be used to
    enter one of the defined NeXus classes. Those above the dashed line
    are valid in the context of the selected tree item, but any of the
    other classes can also be selected.

    .. note:: If you click on the dropdown menus and hover over any
              item, a tooltip gives a description of its use.

**Initialize Data**
    Adds a NeXus field to the selected tree item with the specified
    shape and data type, but without a predefined value. This is useful
    when creating large arrays that have to be entered as slabs. The
    shape box must contain a single integer, for a one-dimensional
    array, or a tuple (or list) of integers, for a multidimensional
    array. As with the 'Add Data' dialog, dropdown menus show the field
    names defined by the NeXus standard.

**Rename Data**
    Renames the selected tree item. If the item is a group, its class
    can also be changed. Dropdown menus provide a list of valid group
    classes or field names defined by the NeXus standard.

**Copy Data**
    Copies the selected tree item to a copy buffer.

**Paste Data**
    Pastes the copy buffer to the selected group. If the selected group
    is in a file open with read/write access, all fields in the copy
    buffer are copied to the file. If the selected group is not
    currently stored in a file and any field in the copy buffer is too
    large to be stored in memory, its data is copied to an HDF5
    memory-mapped file using the h5py copy module.

**Paste As Link**
    Pastes a link to the copied node in the selected group. If the
    copied node and the selected group have different roots, the copied
    node is added to the group as an external link.

    .. note:: External links can only be modified through the parent
              file, which can be opened using the 'Show Link' menu item
              (see below).

    .. warning:: The file containing the external link is referenced
                 using the file path to the parent file. If the files
                 are moved without preserving their relative file
                 paths, the link will be broken.

**Delete Data**
    Deletes the selected tree item.

    .. note:: If the item was assigned to another variable in the
              shell, that variable will not be deleted.

    .. warning:: If the NeXus tree was loaded from a file with
                 read/write access, the data will be immediately
                 deleted from the file. This action is irreversible.

**Show Link**
    Selects the field or group to which the selected item is linked, if
    it is an NXlink object, *i.e.*, shown with a link icon. If the link
    is external, the linked file is automatically opened and the linked
    object is selected.

**Set Signal**
    Sets the plottable signal either to the selected field or to any
    field within the selected group. A dialog box allows the user to
    specify axes with compatible dimensions to plot the data against.

    .. note:: The use of the 'Add Data' and 'Set Signal' menu items
              allows, in principle, an entire NeXus data tree to be
              constructed using menu calls.

**Set Default**
    This sets the `default` attribute in the parent group to the
    currently selected group, *i.e.*, if the selected group is an NXdata
    (NXentry) group, the attribute will be set in the parent NXentry
    (NXroot) group. The `default` attribute is used to identify the
    default data to be plotted.

    .. note:: When a NXdata group is set as the default, the parent
              NXentry group is also set as the default in the parent
              NXroot group provided one has not already been set. The
              default entry can be overridden.

**Fit Data**
    Fits the selected tree item. This assumes that the selected item is
    a valid NXdata group. The menu item triggers a dialog box, which
    allows functions to be chosen and parameters to be initialized
    before calling a non-linear least-squares fitting module.

    .. seealso:: `Fitting NeXus Data`_.

Window Menu
^^^^^^^^^^^
**Show Tree**
    Brings the tree view to the front and give it keyboard focus.

    .. note:: This has the keyboard shortcut of Ctrl+Shift+T (⌘+⇧+T on
              a Mac).

**Show IPython Shell**
    Brings the shell to the front and give it keyboard focus.

    .. note:: This has the keyboard shortcut of Ctrl+Shift+I (⌘+⇧+I on
              a Mac).

**Show Log File**
    Opens a text window displaying the NeXpy log file(s). These files,
    which are stored in ``~/.nexpy/nexpy.log``,
    ``~/.nexpy/nexpy.log.1``, *etc*., records operations on the tree
    items, as well as comprehensive tracebacks of exceptions in both the
    GUI and the IPython shell. Only one-line summaries are displayed in
    the shell to improve readability.

    .. note:: The log files contain ANSI markup to colorize the text,
              which can be rendered in the terminal using ``less -r``.

**Show Script Editor**
    Shows the script editor. If multiple scripts are open, they are
    displayed as tabs in a single window. If no scripts are open, this
    will open a new script.

**Show Customize Panel**
    This opens a panel for the currently active plotting window that
    allows aspects of the plot, such as titles, axis labels, aspect
    ratios, skew angles, marker and line colors, and legends to be
    customized. All the open panels are displayed as tabs in a single
    window.

    .. image:: /images/customize-panel.png
       :align: center
       :width: 90%

    .. note:: This is equivalent to clicking the Edit button in the
              Options Tab.

**Show Limits Panel**
    This opens a panel for the currently active plotting window that
    allows the axes and axis limits of the currently active plot to be
    changed, as well as the plot size on the screen. All the panels are
    displayed as tabs in a single window, with the option of copying and
    values from one tab to the other if the plots are compatible. If the
    'sync' button is checked, the limits will be synchronized
    dynamically to any changes made to the other plot, whether made on
    the Limits Panel or directly in the plot. Multiple plots can be
    synchronized to a single plot.

    .. image:: /images/limits-panel.png
       :align: center
       :width: 90%

    .. note:: When the settings in one tab are copied to another and
              the Apply button is clicked, other settings, such as the
              aspect ratio, skew angle, color map, and log settings are
              also copied. This is therefore a very quick way of making
              direct comparisons between different data sets.

    .. note:: The plotting pane in the main window cannot be resized
              this way, because of the constraints of the other tree
              and shell panes. Other plotting windows will copy the
              main window plotting size if requested.

**Show Projection Panel**
    This opens a panel for the currently active plotting window to allow
    projections along arbitrary axes to be plotted and/or saved. The
    projections are either two-dimensional or, if the y-box is set to
    'None', one-dimensional. The projections may be plotted in a
    separate window, using the 'Plot' button or saved to a scratch
    NXdata group on the tree. If 'Sum' is checked, the projection
    contains the sum over all the summed pixels; if not, the projection
    contains the average, *i.e.*, the sum divided by the number of
    pixels in each orthogonal dimension. If a one-dimensional projection
    is plotted, a checkbox appears allowing additional one-dimensional
    projections to be plotted over it.

    The x and y limits of the plot are displayed as a dashed rectangle,
    which can be hidden if 'Hide Limits' is checked. Dragging with the
    right-button depressed can be used to change the limits without
    replotting.

    .. note:: On systems without a right mouse button, right-click
              dragging can usually be accomplished by other means,
              *e.g.*, two-finger drags on a trackpad or dragging with
              the [Ctrl]-key depressed.

    All the open projection panels are displayed as tabs in a single
    window, with the option of copying projection values from one tab to
    the other if the plots are compatible.

    .. image:: /images/projection-panel.png
       :align: center
       :width: 90%

    .. note:: The projection panel can also be used to mask and unmask
              data within the dashed rectangle. See :doc:`pythonshell`
              for descriptions of masked arrays.

**Show Scan Panel**
    This opens a panel for plotting data across multiple files in the
    NeXpy tree. The limits are used to define projection of the
    currently plotted data, which is to be plotted against the variable
    defined by the path in the Scan field. This path can either be
    entered manually, or by selecting a scalar quantity in the tree and
    clicking the 'Select Scan' button. The 'Select Files' button is then
    used to define the loaded files to be included in the scan. Values
    of the scanned variable are automatically read from the file and
    entered in the box by the corresponding file, where they can be
    edited if necessary.

    .. image:: /images/scan-panel.png
       :align: center
       :width: 90%

**Reset Plot Limits**
    This restores the axis and signal limits to the original values.

    .. note:: This is equivalent to clicking on the Home button in the
              Options Tab (see below). Right-clicking within the plot
              restores the axis limits but does not reset the signal
              limits.

**New Plot Window**
    Opens a new NeXpy plotting window, consisting of a Matplotlib plot
    pane and its associated axis panels. NeXpy plot commands will be
    directed to the currently active window. Clicking on the plot pane
    makes it active. All open windows are listed in the Window menu,
    along with their labels ('Main', 'Figure 1', 'Figure 2', *etc*.).
    These are used to switch the focus for subsequent plots.

    .. note:: If Matplotlib windows are opened from the IPython shell
              using the standard Pyplot commands, *e.g.*,
              ``plt.figure()``, they are numbered independently and
              will not be added to the NeXpy menu. They can be modified
              using the standard Pyplot commands.

**Equalize Plot Sizes**
    All plot windows are resized to match the main window.

**Main, Figure 1, Figure 2...**
    These menu items set the selected plotting window to be active. As
    new windows are created, they are dynamically added to this list.

Script Menu
^^^^^^^^^^^
**New Script**
    Opens a new script in an editable text window with syntax coloring.
    The Python code can be run within the IPython console at any time
    using the console namespace. That means that all the items on the
    NeXpy tree are also accessible without further imports.

    The scripts can be saved for future use from within NeXpy or from
    the terminal command line. They can therefore be formatted as a
    Python standalone script to be either run as ``python script.py`` or
    run in the console (similar to the IPython 'run magic', *i.e.*,
    ``%run -i script.py``). Script arguments can be entered in a
    separate text window at the bottom of the window and accessed within
    the script in the 'sys.argv' list.

    .. note:: Script arguments are just text strings, so if the
              argument is a node on the tree, it must be referenced as a tree dictionary item, *e.g.*, ``nxtree[sys.argv[1]]``

    Scripts are saved, by default, in ``~/.nexpy/scripts``, and are
    automatically added to the bottom of the Script Menu.

**Open Script**
    Opens an existing Python script file in an editable text window.

.. note:: The currently selected node in the NeXpy tree can be
          referenced in the script as ``treeview.node``.

**Open Startup Script**
    Opens the startup script, ``~/.nexpy/config.py``, which is run when
    NeXpy is launched. This can be used to customize imports and other
    settings that affect the IPython shell.

Help Menus
^^^^^^^^^^

Other Menus
^^^^^^^^^^^
The Edit and View Menus consist of menu items provided by the Jupyter Qt
Console. All these operations act on the shell text.

Adding NeXus Data to the Tree
-----------------------------
NXroot groups that are displayed in the tree pane are all children of a
group of class NXtree, known as 'tree'. If you create a NeXus group
dynamically in the IPython shell, it can be added to the tree pane using
the tree's add method::

 >>> a=NXroot()
 >>> a.entry = NXentry()
 >>> nxtree.add(a)

If the group is an NXroot group, it will have the name used in the
shell. If the group is not an NXroot group, the data will be wrapped
automatically in an NXroot group and given a default name that doesn't
conflict with existing tree nodes, *e.g.*, w4.

.. note:: The NXroot class is still considered to be the root of the
          NeXus tree in shell commands. The NXtree group is only used
          by the GUI and cannot be saved to a file.

.. warning:: In Python, an object may be accessible within the shell
             with more than one name. NeXpy searches the shell
             dictionary for an object with the same ID as the added
             NeXus object and so may choose a different name. The
             object in the tree can be renamed.

Plotting NeXus Data
-------------------
NXdata, NXmonitor, and NXlog data can be plotted by selecting a group on
the tree and choosing "Plot Data" from the Data menu or by
double-clicking the item on the tree (or right-clicking for over-plots).
Below the plot pane, a series of tabs allow manipulation of the plot
limits and parameters using text boxes and sliders.

.. note:: The slider ranges are initially set by the data limits. You
          can redefine the slider ranges by editing their respective
          minimum and/or maximum text boxes. The original range can be
          restored by clicking on the Home button in the Options Tab or right-clicking within the plot.

**Signal Tab**

    .. image:: /images/signal-tab.png
       :align: center
       :width: 75%

    The signal tab contains text boxes and sliders to adjust the
    intensity limits, a checkbox to plot the intensity on a log scale,
    and two dropdown menus to select a color palette and a 2D
    interpolation method.

    The color palettes are divided into three sections, separating
    perceptually uniform palettes at the top, miscellaneous palettes,
    and diverging palettes at the bottom. See the `Matplotlib
    documentation <http://matplotlib.org/users/colormaps.html>`__ for
    more details.

    If a diverging color scale is used, the signal is assumed to be
    symmetric about 0, so the minimum box and slider are disabled and
    their values set to the negative of the maximum values. If a log
    scale is chosen, a `symmetric log plot
    <http://matplotlib.org/users/colormapnorms.html#symmetric-logarithmic>`__
    is displayed, with threshold and scale parameters adjustable using
    the command-line `symlog` command (see below).

    .. note:: For a one-dimensional plot, there is no signal tab. The
              intensity is adjusted using the y-tab. There is also no
              signal tab for an RGB(A) image, since the colors are
              defined by the RGB(A) values.

    .. note:: The interpolation methods are the default options
              provided by Matplotlib, which are only available for 2D
              data with a regular grid.

    .. note:: If the `astropy <http://www.astropy.org>`__ module is
              installed, the interpolation dropdown menu includes a
              `convolve` option. Strictly speaking, this is not an
              interpolation method, since it performs a Gaussian
              smoothing of the data, with a standard deviation set by
              the `smooth` option (see below). The default is 2 pixels.

**X Tab**

    .. image:: /images/x-tab.png
       :align: center
       :width: 75%

    The x and y-tabs contains text boxes and sliders to adjust the axis
    limits and a dropdown menu to select the axis to be plotted along x
    or y, respectively. The names correspond to the axis names in the
    NXdata group. A checkbox allows the direction of the axes to be
    flipped.

    .. warning:: Flipping the axis directions does not flip the
                 direction of the sliders.

**Y Tab**

    .. image:: /images/y-tab.png
       :align: center
       :width: 75%

    The y-tab has three additions to the features in the x-tab:

    #. Since multiple one-dimensional data sets can be plotted on the
       same figure, an additional pull-down menu is added on the
       left-hand side to select them.
    #. Selecting the 'smooth' checkbox adds a line that smoothly
       interpolates one-dimensional data. This uses the `SciPy interp1d
       function
       <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.interp1d.html>`__.
       This option is provided to add guides-to-the-eye, and should be
       used for numerical analysis with caution.
    #. The 'Fit' button will open a panel for fitting the data using the
       `LMFIT package <https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/>`__.

    .. seealso:: `Fitting NeXus Data`_


**Z Tab**

    .. image:: /images/z-tab.png
       :align: center
       :width: 90%

    If the data rank is three or more, the 2D plot *vs* x and y is a
    projection along the remaining axes. The z-tab sets the limits for
    those projections. It contains a dropdown menu for selecting the
    axis to be averaged or summed over and two text boxes for selecting
    the projection limits. When the data are first plotted, only the top
    slice if plotted, *i.e.*, all the z-axis limits are set to their
    minimum value.

    .. note:: Projections are now averaged over the summed bins by
              default. To restore the previous behavior, click the
              'Sum' checkbox in the Projection Tab.

    When 'Lock' is checked, the difference between the limits of the
    selected z-axis is fixed. This allows successive images along the
    z-axis to be plotted by clicking the text-box arrows in increments
    of the difference between the two limits. If you use the text-box
    arrows or the terminal arrow keys to change the z-limits when they
    are locked together, the new plot is updated automatically.
    Otherwise, the data is only replotted when you force a replot using
    the toolbar (see below).

    .. note:: Make sure that the value of both limit boxes is entered,
              *e.g.*, by pressing return after editing their values,
              before clicking on the 'lock' checkbox.

    When stepping through the z-values, the 'Autoscale' checkbox
    determines whether the plot automatically scales the signal to the
    maximum intensity of the slice or is set to the current signal
    limits.

    .. note:: When 'Autoscale' is checked, it is not possible to adjust
              the limits in the Signal Tab.

    .. image:: /images/z-toolbar.png
       :align: right

    The toolbar on the right provides further controls for replotting
    data as a function of z. The first button on the left forces a
    replot, *e.g.*, when you have changed z-axis limits or turned on
    auto-scaling. The other buttons are for stepping through the
    z-values automatically, with 'back', 'pause', and 'forward'
    controls. The default speed is one frame per second, but after the
    first click on the play button, subsequent clicks will reduce the
    frame interval by a factor two.

**Projection Tab**

    .. image:: /images/projection-tab.png
       :align: center
       :width: 90%

    The projection tab allows the Projection, Limits, and Scan panels to
    be opened. In v2.0.0, it also allows the aspect ratio and skew angle
    to be defined and a new plot window to be opened containing the
    currently plotted two-dimensional data rotated at an arbitrary
    angle. This allows projections to be applied along non-orthogonal
    axes.

    .. note:: In v2.0.0, arbitrary one-dimensional cuts through the
              current two-dimensional plot can be plotted in a new
              window by dragging along the required line with the Shift
              key depressed. Subsequent cuts will be overplotted in
              this window until it is closed.

    .. image:: /images/rotation-plot.png
       :align: center
       :width: 90%




**Options Tab**

    .. image:: /images/options-tab.png
       :align: center
       :width: 90%

    The options tab is based on the standard Matplotlib toolbar, with
    the the addition of extra buttons. From left to right, the buttons
    are:

    * **Home** - restores all plotting limits to their original values.
    * **Arrows** - cycles through the limits of previous plots.
    * **Pan** - enables panning mode (disabling zoom mode).
    * **Zoom** - enables zoom mode (disabling pan mode).
    * **Aspect** - toggles between setting the aspect ratio
      automatically to fill the available space or setting the x and y
      scales to be equal. This is only valid if the units of the x and y
      axes are identical.
    * **Subplot** - configures the spacing around the plot.
    * **Edit** - opens the Customize Panel to edit both image and point
      plots. Use this to change the title and axis labels, modify the
      image aspect ratio and skew angles, turn axis grids on or off and
      set their styles, modify the point plot markers and lines, scale
      or add an offset to 1D plots, and draw legends.
    * **Save** - saves plot to PNG file.
    * **Export** - exports plotted data to a NeXus file or, for
      one-dimensional data, a multi-column ASCII file.
    * **Add** - adds plotted data to the tree pane as an NXdata group
      within the scratch workspace 'w0'.

    On the far right of the toolbar, the data and axis values are
    dynamically updated to the values under the current mouse location.

    .. seealso:: See the `Matplotlib documentation
                 <https://matplotlib.org/users/navigation_toolbar.html>`__ for more detailed descriptions of the
                 standard toolbar, including keyboard shortcuts. The
                 'Aspect', 'Export', and 'Add' buttons are unique to
                 NeXpy.

    .. note:: The aspect ratio of a plot can also be set from the
              IPython shell. See below.

**Command Line Options**

    It is possible to modify some of the plotting features from the
    IPython shell. The current plotting pane, the default Matplotlib
    axis instance, and the current image are exposed as ``plotview``,
    ``plotview.ax``, and ``plotview.image``, respectively.

    .. note:: Before making any changes, make sure that you have
              selected the right plotting pane, either by selecting it
              in the Window menu or using one of the keyboard
              shortcuts, which are displayed in the menu, *e.g.*, <Ctrl>
              +2 (⌘+2 on a Mac) to select Figure 2.

* Set Aspect Ratio::

    >>> plotview.aspect = <aspect>

  ``<aspect>`` can be any of the values allowed by the `Matplotlib
  set_aspect
  <https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/axes_api.html#aspect-ratio>`__
  function, *i.e.*, 'auto', 'equal', or the numerical value of the ratio
  between the height and the width (if the units are identical). The
  'Aspect' button (see above) toggles between 'auto' and 'equal'. This
  can also be set using the 'Edit Parameters' button on the Options tab.

* Set Skew Angle::

    >>> plotview.skew = <angle>

  This sets the angle between the x and y-axes in degrees. If set to
  ``None``, the axes are plotted as orthogonal. If ``plotview.aspect``
  is currently set to 'auto', this command will automatically set it to
  1.0 (equivalent to 'equal'), *i.e.*, assuming the units of the x and
  y-axes are the same. If they are not, ``plotview.aspect`` should be
  set to the ratio of their units. This can also be set using the 'Edit
  Parameters' button on the Options tab.

.. image:: /images/skewed-axis.png
   :align: center
   :width: 75%

* Set Smoothing Width::

    >>> plotview.smooth = <stddev>

  This sets the standard deviation in pixels for the Gaussian smoothing
  of the data performed when the 'convolve' option is selected in the
  Signal tab. The default value is 2.

* Set Offsets::

    >>> plotview.offsets = <True|False>

  If the range of an axis is much smaller than the absolute values, the
  axis labels can overlap. Setting this option will determine whether
  Matplotlib converts the axis labels to differences from a fixed offset
  value or not. The default is ``False``.

* Select Color Map::

    >>> plotview.cmap = <cmap>

  This allows the color map of the currently displayed image to be
  changed. This can be useful if the map is not available in the Signal
  Tab. See the `Matplotlib documentation
  <http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html#matplotlib.pyplot.set_cmap>`__
  for more details.

* Draw Shapes::

    >>> plotview.vline(<x>, <ymin>, <ymax>)
    >>> plotview.hline(<y>, <xmin>, <xmax>)
    >>> plotview.vlines(<x-array>, <ymin>, <ymax>)
    >>> plotview.hlines(<y-array>, <xmin>, <xmax>)
    >>> plotview.crosshairs(<x>, <y>)
    >>> plotview.rectangle(<x>, <y>, <dx>, <dy>)
    >>> plotview.circle(<x>, <y>, <radius>)
    >>> plotview.ellipse(<x>, <y>, <dx>, <dy>)

  These functions draw graphical primitives on the plot using the axis
  coordinates. In the case of the lines, the complete range of the plot
  will be used if the minimum and maximum values are omitted. The
  rectangle coordinates represent the lower left-hand corner but the
  circle and ellipse coordinates represent the shape center.

  .. note:: Since the arguments are in the units of the axes, the circle will
            only be truly circular if the x and y units are the same, and the
            aspect ratio of the plot is equal.

  All of the functions will accept additional keyword arguments used in
  drawing Matplotlib shapes, *e.g.*, to change the edge and fill colors,
  line properties, *etc*. See the `Matplotlib documentation
  <http://matplotlib.org/api/patches_api.html#matplotlib.patches.Polygon>`__
  for more details.

* Draw Grid:

    >>> plotview.grid(True|False)

  Draws grid lines at the major tick values. Additional keyword
  arguments can be given to modify the color, linestyle, *etc*, using
  the standard `Matplotlib conventions
  <http://matplotlib.org/api/axes_api.html?highlight=grid#matplotlib.axes.Axes.grid>`__.

* Draw Legend::

    >>> plotview.legend(*items, *opts)

  This draws a legend using the standard Matplotlib API, *i.e.*, it is
  broadly equivalent to calling ``plotview.ax.legend()``. It is only
  intended to be used for one-dimensional plots. By default, the labels
  will contain the full path to each plotted field, but setting the
  keyword argument, ``nameonly=True`` will restrict the label to the
  field name.

  .. note:: Legend labels, positions, and other attributes can be
            modified in the Customize Dialog.

* Convert to Symmetric Log Plot:

    >>> plotview.symlog(linthresh, linscale, vmax)

  Plot the data using symmetric logarithms for both positive and
  negative data. The ``linthresh`` and ``linscale`` parameters are used
  to define the linear region interpolating between the positive and
  negative log regions. See the `Matplotlib documentation
  <http://matplotlib.org/users/colormapnorms.html#symmetric-logarithmic>`__
  for more details. The maximum and minimum signal values are set to +/-
  vmax.

  Calling ``symlog`` will set the ``linthresh`` and ``linscale``
  parameters for future plots. Call it without any parameters to set
  them to their default values, ``linthresh=vmax/10`` and
  ``linscale=0.1``.

  .. note:: There are a number of diverging color maps, such as
            ``coolwarm``, that are ideal for displaying symmetric log
            data. Some are available at the bottom of the color map
            dropdown menu in the Signal tab.

**Keyboard Shortcuts**

    A number of keyboard shortcuts are defined when focus is on the
    plotting window. These can be used to switch between tabs or set
    various plotting options.

    .. note:: Keyboard focus can be switched to a particular plotting
              window by (a) clicking within the window, (b) using the Window menu, or (c) typing Ctrl+'n' (⌘+'n' on a Mac), where 'n' is the plot window number.

    * **s** - switch to the Signal tab.
    * **x** - switch to the X tab.
    * **y** - switch to the Y tab.
    * **z** - switch to the Z tab.
    * **p** - switch to the Projection tab.
    * **o** - switch to the Options tab.
    * **l** - toggle logarithmic signal scale (2D plots only).
    * **g** - toggle display of major and minor grid.
    * **G** - toggle display of major grid.
    * **P** - toggle panning mode (if enabled, zoom mode is disabled).
    * **Z** - toggle zoom mode (if enabled, pan mode is disabled).
    * **E** - toggle the aspect ratio between 'equal' and 'automatic'.
    * **S** - save plot to a graphics file.
    * **A** - add plotted data to the tree pane.
    * **O** - open dialog to customize plots.

Configuring NeXpy
-----------------
When NeXpy if first launched, a private directory is created in the home
directory, ~/.nexpy/. This is used to store log files, backups, plugins,
and scripts. A configuration file, ~/.nexpy/config.py, is created to
contain Python commands that should be run at the start of every
session.

By default, the configuration file contains a number of imports,
including all the functions and classes defined by the nexusformat
package. ::

 import nexpy
 import nexusformat.nexus as nx
 from nexusformat.nexus import *

This file could also be used to change the default parameters used by
the nexusformat package to define, *e.g.*, memory limits, maximum loaded
array sizes, file locking, default HDF5 compression, and default string
encodings. See :doc:`pythonshell` for more details.

For convenience, the configuration file also imports a number of other
modules that are commonly used::

 import sys
 import os
 import h5py as h5
 import numpy as np
 import numpy.ma as ma
 import scipy as sp
 import matplotlib as mpl
 from matplotlib import pylab, mlab, pyplot
 plt = pyplot

If you require a different set of imports or prefer alternative
abbreviations, edit the configuration file using``Open Startup
Script...`` in the Script Menu.

Fitting NeXus Data
------------------
NeXpy makes it easy to fit one-dimensional data using the
`LMFIT package <https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/>`__, with a 'Fit' button in
the Y-Tab of every one-dimensional plot.

.. note:: If multiple data sets are plotted in the same window, the one
          to be fit can be selected using the pull-down menu on the far
          left of the Y-Tab. Multiple data sets can be selected for
          fitting at the same time, each one opening a new tab in the
          Fit Panel. Line plots of the models and their components will
          be plotted in the same color as the corresponding data.

Alternatively, choosing 'Fit Data' from the Data menu or using the
keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+F (⌘+⇧+F on a Mac), will fit data selected
in the Tree Pane.

Either method opens a dialog window that allows multiple fit models to
be combined, with the option of fixing or limiting parameters. To help
in selecting a model, click on the pull-down menu and the model
description will be displayed as a tooltip when you hover over it.

.. image:: /images/nexpy-fits.png
   :align: center
   :width: 90%

The fit can be plotted, along with the constituent models in the main
plotting window and the fitting parameters displayed in the Fit Panel.

.. note:: The data are only fitted within the x-limits of the current
          plot. This can be used, for example, to perform piece-wise
          fits of multiple peaks before a final fit that combines them
          all together.

Initializing Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
LMFIT models often define a function to *guess* initial parameters from
the data. If multiple peaks are to be fitted, sensible starting
parameters for each one can be determined by moving the x-limits to
cover a single peak when adding the peak model. Then, the x-limits can
be restored before fitting all the peaks together.

Masking Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Data points can be masked so that they are excluded from the fit.
Individual points can be removed by double-clicking on the point marker.
A set of x-values can be excluded by right-click dragging over the
required range and then clicking on 'Mask Data'. Masks can be cleared by
clicking on 'Clear Masks'.

Modifying Constraints
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Parameters can be fixed or constrained with minimum and maximum limits
in the Fit Panel. However, LMFIT also allows parameters to be bound to
the values of one or more other parameters by algebraic expressions.
These expressions can be defined or modified by clicking on 'Σ' button
at the end of the parameter row. Pull-down menus allow parameters from
any of the currently added models to be inserted into these expressions.

Composing Models
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When models are added using the 'Add Model' button, they are combined to
produce a composite model, in which they are added together by default.
However, LMFIT allows composite models to be combined using different
operators (add, subtract, multiply, and divide), defined by an algebraic
expression. For example, a BoseFactor model, with temperature its only
parameter, is provided by NeXpy. If it is combined with a peak model,
using the 'multiply' operator, it will apply a detailed balance factor
appropriate for modeling quasielastic neutron scattering.

A 'Compose Model' button allows the algebraic expression combining the
currently added models to be edited.

It is also possible to combine a subset of models when plotting the
fitted models, by selecting 'Composite Model' before clicking 'Plot
Model'. This allows, for example, several functions representing a
background to be combined before they are plotted.

.. seealso:: `LMFIT Composite Models
             <https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/model.html#composite-models-adding-or-multiplying-models>`__

Saving the Fit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The original data, the fitted data, constituent models, and the
parameters can all be saved to an NXprocess group in the Tree Pane,
using the 'Save Fit' button, for subsequent plotting, refitting, or
copying to another NeXus file. The group, named 'f1', 'f2', etc., is
stored in the default scratch NXroot group, w0. If you choose to fit
this entry again, it will load the models and parameters from the saved
fit.

Closing the Fit Panel
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If the Fit Panel was opened by clicking the 'Fit' button in Y-Tab, line
plots of the models and their components are superposed on the existing
plot window. These line plots will be erased when the corresponding tab
in the Fit Panel is closed. However, if the 'Apply' button is clicked
before closing the tab, the line plot representing the combined model
will be preserved until the plot window is closed.

Defining a Model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
NeXpy makes available any of the models currently supplied by the `LMFIT
package <https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/builtin_models.html>`__, as
well as a couple of extra models added to the NeXpy package, the
OrderParameterModel and the PDFdecayModel. If you wish to construct your
own model, please refer to the LMFIT documentation for more details.

User-defined models can be added as separate files to their private
models directory in ``~/.nexpy/models`` (new to v0.12.6). As an example,
here is the code for the OrderParameterModel that is distributed with
NeXpy::

    import numpy as np

    from lmfit.model import Model

    class OrderParameterModel(Model):
        r"""A model to describe the temperature dependence of an order parameter
        with three Parameters: ``amplitude``, ``Tc``, and ``beta``.

        .. math::

            f(x; A, Tc, \beta) = A ((Tc - x[x<Tc])/ Tc)^\beta

        where the parameter ``amplitude`` corresponds to :math:`A`, ``Tc`` to
        :math:`Tc`, and ``beta`` to :math:`\beta`.
        """
        def __init__(self, **kwargs):

            def op(x, amplitude=1.0, Tc=100.0, beta=0.5):
                v = np.zeros(x.shape)
                v[x<Tc] = amplitude * ((Tc - x[x<Tc])/ Tc)**beta
                v[x>=Tc] = 0.0
                return v

            super().__init__(op, **kwargs)

        def guess(self, data, x=None, negative=False, **kwargs):
            """Estimate initial model parameter values from data."""
            return self.make_params(amplitude=data.max(), Tc=x.mean(), beta=0.33)

.. warning:: Prior to v0.12.6, NeXpy defined its own system for
             generating fitting functions. This system is now
             deprecated, but legacy functions are still available at
             the end of the model list. If you have produced your own
             functions in the past, they will also be on this list.
             However, we recommend that all new functions now adhere to
             LMFIT model definitions.

Importing NeXus Data
--------------------
NeXpy can import data stored in a number of other formats, including
SPEC files, TIFF images, and text files, using the File:Import menus. If
a file format is not currently supported, the user can write their own.
The following is an example of a module that reads the original format
and returns NeXus data::

 def get_data(filename):
     from libtiff import TIFF
     im = TIFF.open(filename)
     z = im.read_image()
     y = range(z.shape[0])
     x = range(z.shape[1])
     return NXentry(NXdata(z,(y,x)))

This could be run in the shell pane and then added to the tree using::

 >>> nxtree.add(get_data('image.tif'))

Existing Readers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
NeXpy is currently distributed with readers for the following format:

**SPEC Files**

This reader will read multiple SPEC scans from a single SPEC log file,
creating a separate NXentry for each scan. All the columns in each scan
are read into the NXdata group, with the default signal defined by the
last column. Mesh scans are converted to multi-dimensional data, with
axes defined by the scan command. It is possible to plot different
columns once the scans are imported.

**TIFF Images**

This reader will import most TIFF images, including those with floating
point pixels. This currently uses the `tifffile
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tifffile>`__ module. Use the ``Open
Image...`` dialog to use the `FabIO library
<https://pythonhosted.org/fabio/>`__.

**Image Stack**

This reader will read a stack of images, which are readable by `FabIO
<https://pythonhosted.org/fabio/>`__, *e.g.*, TIFF or CBF, into a
three-dimensional NXdata group. The image stack must be stored in
separate files in a single directory, that are grouped with a common
prefix followed by an integer defining the stack sequence.

**Text Files**

This reader will read ASCII data stored in two or three columns,
containing the x and y values, and, optionally, errors. One or more
header lines can be skipped. A more flexible text importer, allowing the
selection of data from multiple columns, is under development.

Defining a Reader
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
It is possible to add a reader to the File:Import menu using the
existing samples as a guide in the nexpy.readers directory. User-defined
import dialogs can be added to their private readers directory in
``~/.nexpy/readers``.

Here is an example of an import dialog::

 """
 Module to read in a TIFF file and convert it to NeXus.

 Each importer needs to layout the GUI buttons necessary for defining
 the imported file and its attributes and a single module, get_data,
 which returns an NXroot or NXentry object. This will be added to the
 NeXpy tree.

 Two GUI elements are provided for convenience:

     ImportDialog.filebox: Contains a "Choose File" button and a text
                           box. Both can be used to set the path to the
                           imported file. This can be retrieved as
                           string using self.get_filename().
     ImportDialog.close_buttons: Contains a "Cancel" and "OK" button to
                                 close the dialog. This should be
                                 placed at the bottom of all import
                                 dialogs.
 """

 import numpy as np
 from nexusformat.nexus import *
 from nexpy.gui.importdialog import NXImportDialog

 filetype = "TIFF Image" #Defines the Import Menu label

 class ImportDialog(NXImportDialog):
     """Dialog to import a TIFF image"""

     def __init__(self, parent=None):

         super().__init__(parent)

         self.set_layout(self.filebox(), self.close_buttons())

         self.set_title("Import "+str(filetype))

     def get_data(self):
         from libtiff import TIFF
         im = TIFF.open(self.get_filename())
         z = NXfield(im.read_image(), name='z')
         y = NXfield(range(z.shape[0]), name='y')
         x = NXfield(range(z.shape[1]), name='x')
         return NXentry(NXdata(z,(y,x)))

NeXpy Plugins
-------------
It is possible to customize NeXpy by adding new menus to the main menu
bar with sub-menus that open GUI dialogs orperform operations that are
specific to a specialized application.

Installing Plugins
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
NeXpy plugins are contained within external packages, which are
installed separately. The package metadata should declare an entry point
labelled ``nexpy.plugins``, which points to the package module
containing the plugin code. Details of what this code should contain are
given in the next section.

An example package, that is installable using ``pip install  .`` is
available in the NeXpy package examples directory.

.. note:: The plugin code can also be installed in the user's home
          directory (in ``~/.nexpy/plugins``), which will be searched
          on startup for any valid plugin modules. These do not have to
          be configured as installable packages. However, in v2.0.0,
          plugins can no longer be installed into the NeXpy pacakge
          itself.

In v2.0.0, a new "Manage Plugins" dialog allows any plugins to be
enabled/disabled, and their order in the menu bar changed. Duplicate
menu names will not be loaded, but a warning will be added to the NeXpy
log file.

Defining Plugins
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The modules that are accessed through the plugin menu should be defined
as a Python package, *i.e.*, by creating a sub-directory that contains
``__init__.py``. This must contain a function, ``plugin_menu``, which
returns the name to be added to the top-level NeXpy menu bar, and a list
of tuples, each of which contains the sub-menu name and the
corresponding function triggered by clicking on it.

There is an example package, ``chopper_plugin``, in the
``nexpy.examples`` directory, to show how plugins should be configured.
It adds a top-level menu item, ``Chopper``, that has a couple of
sub-menu items to perform data analysis on the example file,
``chopper.nxs``, which is also distributed with NeXpy.

Here is the structure of the ``chopper_plugin`` package::

    chopper_plugin:
    └── pyproject.toml
    └── chopper
        ├── __init.py__
        ├── convert_qe.py
        └── get_ei.py

.. note:: If the plugin is stored in ``~/.nexpy/plugins``, just include
          the ``chopper`` sub-directory in the above file tree.

Here is the ``pyproject.toml`` file::

    [build-system]
    requires = ["setuptools", "setuptools-scm"]
    build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

    [project]
    name = "chopper_plugin"
    version = "1.0.0"
    dependencies = [
        "nexpy"
    ]

    [project.entry-points."nexpy.plugins"]
    chopper = "chopper:plugin_menu"

This is sufficient to install the plugin using ``pip`` and make it
discoverable by NeXpy through ``nexpy.plugins`` entry point. If the
plugin is embedded within a larger package, adjust the entry point so
that it points to the sub-directory containing the ``__init__.py`` file
that defines the ``plugin_menu`` function. For example, if the plugin
modules are contained within the ``plugins`` sub-directory of
``mypackage``, add the following entry point::

    [project.entry-points."nexpy.plugins"]
    plugin_name = "mypackage.plugins.plugin_name:plugin_menu"

.. seealso:: Information on defining entry points in external packages
             that do not use a ``pyproject.toml`` file is available in
             the `Setup Tools documentation
             <https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/entry_point.html>`__.

Here is the ``__init__.py`` file, which defines the ``plugin_menu`` function::

  from . import get_ei, convert_qe

  def plugin_menu():
      menu = 'Chopper'
      actions = []
      actions.append(('Get Incident Energy', get_ei.show_dialog))
      actions.append(('Convert to Q-E', convert_qe.show_dialog))
      return menu, actions

The actions define the menu text and the function that gets called when
it is selected. In the example, they are contained within the package as
two files, ``get_ei.py`` and ``convert_qe.py``, but they could also be
in a separately installed package in the Python path.

These files should open a dialog box and perform the required
operations, after which the results can either be saved to a new NeXus
file or saved as modifications to an existing tree item.

For example, ``get_ei.py`` reads the monitor spectra contained within
the currently selected node on the tree, which should have been
previously loaded. It then calculates the difference between the peak
positions of the two spectra, calculates the incident energy, which is
updated in both the dialog box and, if the ``Save`` button is pressed,
in the loaded NeXus tree, ready for subsequent analysis.

In the simplest cases, no knowledge of PyQt is required. In the example
below, a grid defines a set of parameters, functions to read those
parameters from the PySide text boxes (here, they are decorated with
``@property``, which means that the function can be called without an
argument), a couple of buttons to activate different parts of the
analysis, and finally the functions themselves::
