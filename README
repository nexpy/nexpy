Introduction
============
NeXpy provides a high-level python interface to NeXus data contained within a
simple GUI. It is designed to provide an intuitive interactive toolbox allowing 
users both to access existing NeXus files and to create new NeXus-conforming 
data structures without expert knowledge of the file format.

Installing and Running
======================

Released versions of NeXpy are available on PyPI. If you have the Python Setup 
Tools <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools> installed, then you can install 
using either::

    $ pip install nexpy

or:: 

    $ easy_install nexpy 

The latest development versions of NeXpy can be downloaded from the NeXpy Git 
repository <https://github.com/nexpy/nexpy>.

    $ git clone https://github.com/nexpy/nexpy.git

To install in the standard Python location:

    $ cd nexpy
    $ python setup.py install

To install in an alternate location:

    $ python setup.py install --prefix=/path/to/installation/dir

Prerequisites
=============
The following libraries are used by the full installation of NeXpy. There is 
more details of the nature of these dependencies in the NeXpy documentation
(http://nexpy.github.io/nexpy).

PySide v1.1.0        http://www.pyside.org/
jupyter              http://jupyter.org
IPython v1.1.0       http://ipython.org/
h5py                 http://www.h5py.org/
numpy,scipy          http://numpy.scipy.org
matplotlib v1.2.0    http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net  (GUI plotting only)
lmfit                http://newville.github.io/lmfit-py (Fitting only)
spec2nexus           http://spec2nexus.readthedocs.org  (SPEC reader only)

The following environment variable may need to be set

PYTHONPATH --> must include paths to ipython,numpy,scipy,matplotlib if installed 
               in nonstandard place

All of the above are included in the Enthought Python Distribution v7.3.

To run with the GUI
===================

To run from the install location, add the $prefix/bin directory to your path
(only if you installed outside the python installation), and then run:
