<h1>Python Graphical User Interface<a class="headerlink" href="#python-graphical-user-interface" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>A PyQT GUI has been created to make it easier to keep track of the
loaded NeXus files and the results of any subsequent analysis. It is
invoked from the command line by:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">nexpy</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>This assumes that the Python ‘bin’ directory is in your
standard shell path.</p>
</div>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/nexpy-gui.png"><img alt="_images/nexpy-gui.png" class="align-center" src="_images/nexpy-gui.png" style="width: 90%;" /></a>
<p>The illustration shows the main features of the GUI:</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt><strong>1) Tree Pane</strong></dt><dd><p>This contains the tree structure of NeXus or HDF5 files opened in
the File menu, non-NeXus files that have been imported and converted
into the NeXus format using one of the NeXus readers, and NXroot,
NXentry, or NXdata groups added from the shell. Various actions on
the data can be performed by right-clicking a tree item, include
plotting, renaming, fitting and deleting the data.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>2) Plot Pane</strong></dt><dd><p>This contains plots produced by (a) the Data:Plot Data menu item,
which operates on the NeXus data selected in the tree, (b)
double-clicking on NeXus data in the tree, or (c) using NeXus data
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">plot</span></code> methods from the shell. If an NXdata, NXmonitor, or NXlog
group is plotted, the rank, dimensions, and plotting axes are
determined automatically. If the rank of the data is greater than
two, a two-dimensional slice is extracted from the data. The GUI
allows the selection of alternative slices using one of the axis
panels (see below). If an NXfield is selected, the axes can be
chosen from other NXfields in the same group. It is possible to open
other plot windows and switch between them using the Window menu or
keyboard shortcuts (see below).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>3) Shell Pane</strong></dt><dd><p>This is an IPython shell, with NeXpy already imported (as * so no
prefixes are necessary), along with NumPy (as ‘np’), Pyplot (as
‘plt’), and Matplotlib (as ‘mpl’). Any assignments to items in the
tree pane are automatically reflected in the tree pane, and new
NXroot or NXentry objects can be added to the tree from the IPython
shell. NeXus data plots commands from the shell will appear in the
plot pane, and Matplotlib commands can be used to modify the plot
characteristics. The shell has enhanced features such as
autocompletion of NeXus dictionaries and attributes and tooltips
containing module docstrings when you open the module parentheses.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>4) Axis Panels</strong></dt><dd><p>The tabbed panels below the plot can be used to modify the plots.
The number of panels depends on the rank of the original data. The
‘signal’, ‘x’ and ‘y’ panels have text boxes and sliders for
adjusting the plotting limits. For rank two or more, a projection
panel allows the plotting of projections along different directions,
using the current axis limits. For ranks greater than two, a ‘z’
panel allows the other dimensions to be varied. Finally, the
‘options’ panel provides access to the a number of tools for
modifying the plot and saving/exporting the plotted data.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>5) Status Bar</strong></dt><dd><p>The values and attributes of the currently selected item in the tree
are displayed in the status bar.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>6) Tooltips</strong></dt><dd><p>The NeXus tree structure of an item in the tree pane will be
displayed as a tooltip when the cursor hovers over it.</p>

<h2>Plotting NeXus Data<a class="headerlink" href="#plotting-nexus-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>NXdata, NXmonitor, and NXlog data can be plotted by selecting a group on
the tree and choosing “Plot Data” from the Data menu or by
double-clicking the item on the tree (or right-clicking for over-plots).
Below the plot pane, a series of tabs allow manipulation of the plot
limits and parameters using text boxes and sliders.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The slider ranges are initially set by the data limits. You
can redefine the slider ranges by editing their respective
minimum and/or maximum text boxes. The original range can be
restored by clicking on the Home button in the Options Tab or right-clicking within the plot.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Signal Tab</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/signal-tab.png"><img alt="_images/signal-tab.png" class="align-center" src="_images/signal-tab.png" style="width: 75%;" /></a>
<p>The signal tab contains text boxes and sliders to adjust the
intensity limits, a checkbox to plot the intensity on a log scale,
and two dropdown menus to select a color palette and a 2D
interpolation method.</p>
<p>The color palettes are divided into three sections, separating
perceptually uniform palettes at the top, miscellaneous palettes,
and diverging palettes at the bottom. See the <a class="reference external" href="http://matplotlib.org/users/colormaps.html">Matplotlib
documentation</a> for
more details.</p>
<p>If a diverging color scale is used, the signal is assumed to be
symmetric about 0, so the minimum box and slider are disabled and
their values set to the negative of the maximum values. If a log
scale is chosen, a <a class="reference external" href="http://matplotlib.org/users/colormapnorms.html#symmetric-logarithmic">symmetric log plot</a>
is displayed, with threshold and scale parameters adjustable using
the command-line <cite>symlog</cite> command (see below).</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>For a one-dimensional plot, there is no signal tab. The
intensity is adjusted using the y-tab. There is also no
signal tab for an RGB(A) image, since the colors are
defined by the RGB(A) values.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">

<p>If the data rank is three or more, the 2D plot <em>vs</em> x and y is a
projection along the remaining axes. The z-tab sets the limits for
those projections. It contains a dropdown menu for selecting the
axis to be averaged or summed over and two text boxes for selecting
the projection limits. When the data are first plotted, only the top
slice if plotted, <em>i.e.</em>, all the z-axis limits are set to their
minimum value.</p>
<div class="admonition note">

<p>Projections are now averaged over the summed bins by
default. To restore the previous behavior, click the
‘Sum’ checkbox in the Projection Tab.</p>
</div>
<p>When ‘Lock’ is checked, the difference between the limits of the
selected z-axis is fixed. This allows successive images along the
z-axis to be plotted by clicking the text-box arrows in increments
of the difference between the two limits. If you use the text-box
arrows or the terminal arrow keys to change the z-limits when they
are locked together, the new plot is updated automatically.
Otherwise, the data is only replotted when you force a replot using
the toolbar (see below).</p>
<div class="admonition note">

<p>When stepping through the z-values, the ‘Autoscale’ checkbox
determines whether the plot automatically scales the signal to the
maximum intensity of the slice or is set to the current signal
limits.</p>

replot, <em>e.g.</em>, when you have changed z-axis limits or turned on
auto-scaling. The other buttons are for stepping through the
z-values automatically, with ‘back’, ‘pause’, and ‘forward’

<h2>Configuring NeXpy<a class="headerlink" href="#configuring-nexpy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When NeXpy if first launched, a private directory is created in the home
directory, ~/.nexpy/. This is used to store log files, backups, plugins,
and scripts. A configuration file, ~/.nexpy/config.py, is created to
contain Python commands that should be run at the start of every
session.</p>
<p>By default, the configuration file contains a number of imports,
including all the functions and classes defined by the nexusformat
package.</p>

<h2>Fitting NeXus Data<a class="headerlink" href="#fitting-nexus-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>NeXpy makes it easy to fit one-dimensional data using the
<a class="reference external" href="https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/">LMFIT package</a>, with a ‘Fit’ button in
the Y-Tab of every one-dimensional plot.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>If multiple data sets are plotted in the same window, the one
to be fit can be selected using the pull-down menu on the far
left of the Y-Tab. Multiple data sets can be selected for
fitting at the same time, each one opening a new tab in the
Fit Panel. Line plots of the models and their components will
be plotted in the same color as the corresponding data.</p>
</div>
<p>Alternatively, choosing ‘Fit Data’ from the Data menu or using the
keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+F (⌘+⇧+F on a Mac), will fit data selected
in the Tree Pane.</p>
<p>Either method opens a dialog window that allows multiple fit models to
be combined, with the option of fixing or limiting parameters. To help
in selecting a model, click on the pull-down menu and the model
description will be displayed as a tooltip when you hover over it.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/nexpy-fits.png"><img alt="_images/nexpy-fits.png" class="align-center" src="_images/nexpy-fits.png" style="width: 90%;" /></a>
<p>The fit can be plotted, along with the constituent models in the main
plotting window and the fitting parameters displayed in the Fit Panel.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The data are only fitted within the x-limits of the current
plot. This can be used, for example, to perform piece-wise
fits of multiple peaks before a final fit that combines them
all together.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="initializing-parameters">
<h3>Initializing Parameters<a class="headerlink" href="#initializing-parameters" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>LMFIT models often define a function to <em>guess</em> initial parameters from
the data. If multiple peaks are to be fitted, sensible starting
parameters for each one can be determined by moving the x-limits to
cover a single peak when adding the peak model. Then, the x-limits can
be restored before fitting all the peaks together.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="masking-data">
<h3>Masking Data<a class="headerlink" href="#masking-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Data points can be masked so that they are excluded from the fit.
Individual points can be removed by double-clicking on the point marker.
A set of x-values can be excluded by right-click dragging over the
required range and then clicking on ‘Mask Data’. Masks can be cleared by
clicking on ‘Clear Masks’.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="modifying-constraints">
<h3>Modifying Constraints<a class="headerlink" href="#modifying-constraints" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Parameters can be fixed or constrained with minimum and maximum limits
in the Fit Panel. However, LMFIT also allows parameters to be bound to
the values of one or more other parameters by algebraic expressions.
These expressions can be defined or modified by clicking on ‘Σ’ button
at the end of the parameter row. Pull-down menus allow parameters from
any of the currently added models to be inserted into these expressions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="composing-models">
<h3>Composing Models<a class="headerlink" href="#composing-models" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When models are added using the ‘Add Model’ button, they are combined to
produce a composite model, in which they are added together by default.
However, LMFIT allows composite models to be combined using different
operators (add, subtract, multiply, and divide), defined by an algebraic
expression. For example, a BoseFactor model, with temperature its only
parameter, is provided by NeXpy. If it is combined with a peak model,
using the ‘multiply’ operator, it will apply a detailed balance factor
appropriate for modeling quasielastic neutron scattering.</p>
<p>A ‘Compose Model’ button allows the algebraic expression combining the
currently added models to be edited.</p>
<p>It is also possible to combine a subset of models when plotting the
fitted models, by selecting ‘Composite Model’ before clicking ‘Plot
Model’. This allows, for example, several functions representing a
background to be combined before they are plotted.</p>

parameters can all be saved to an NXprocess group in the Tree Pane using
the ‘Copy Fit’ or ‘Save Fit’ buttons. If the ‘Copy Fit’ button is used,
the NXprocess group can be pasted into any group in the tree that is

<h3>Existing Readers<a class="headerlink" href="#existing-readers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>NeXpy is currently distributed with readers for the following format:</p>
<p><strong>SPEC Files</strong></p>
<p>This reader will read multiple SPEC scans from a single SPEC log file,
creating a separate NXentry for each scan. All the columns in each scan
are read into the NXdata group, with the default signal defined by the
last column. Mesh scans are converted to multi-dimensional data, with
axes defined by the scan command. It is possible to plot different
columns once the scans are imported.</p>
<p><strong>TIFF Images</strong></p>
<p>This reader will import most TIFF images, including those with floating
point pixels. This currently uses the <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tifffile">tifffile</a> module. Use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Open</span>
<span class="pre">Image...</span></code> dialog to use the <a class="reference external" href="https://pythonhosted.org/fabio/">FabIO library</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Image Stack</strong></p>
<p>This reader will read a stack of images, which are readable by <a class="reference external" href="https://pythonhosted.org/fabio/">FabIO</a>, <em>e.g.</em>, TIFF or CBF, into a
three-dimensional NXdata group. The image stack must be stored in
separate files in a single directory, that are grouped with a common
prefix followed by an integer defining the stack sequence.</p>
<p><strong>Text Files</strong></p>
<p>This reader will read ASCII data stored in two or three columns,
containing the x and y values, and, optionally, errors. One or more
header lines can be skipped. A more flexible text importer, allowing the
selection of data from multiple columns, is under development.</p>

<h2>NeXpy Plugins<a class="headerlink" href="#nexpy-plugins" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It is possible to customize NeXpy by adding new menus to the main menu
bar with sub-menus that open GUI dialogs orperform operations that are
specific to a specialized application.</p>
<div class="section" id="installing-plugins">
<h3>Installing Plugins<a class="headerlink" href="#installing-plugins" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>NeXpy plugins are contained within external packages, which are
installed separately. The package metadata should declare an entry point
labelled <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nexpy.plugins</span></code>, which points to the package module
containing the plugin code. Details of what this code should contain are
given in the next section.</p>
<p>An example package, that is installable using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pip</span> <span class="pre">install</span>&#160; <span class="pre">.</span></code> is
available in the NeXpy package examples directory.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The plugin code can also be installed in the user’s home
directory (in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">~/.nexpy/plugins</span></code>), which will be searched
on startup for any valid plugin modules. These do not have to
be configured as installable packages. However, in v2.0.0,
plugins can no longer be installed into the NeXpy package
itself.</p>
</div>
<p>The “Manage Plugins” dialog, launched from the File menu, allows any
plugins to be enabled/disabled, and their order in the menu bar changed.
Duplicate menu names will not be loaded, but a warning will be added to
the NeXpy log file.</p>

<h3>Defining Plugins<a class="headerlink" href="#defining-plugins" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The modules that are accessed through the plugin menu should be defined
as a Python package, <em>i.e.</em>, by creating a sub-directory that contains
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__init__.py</span></code>. This must contain a function, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">plugin_menu</span></code>, which
returns the name to be added to the top-level NeXpy menu bar, and a list
of tuples, each of which contains the sub-menu name and the
corresponding function triggered by clicking on it.</p>
<p>There is an example package, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chopper_plugin</span></code>, in the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nexpy.examples</span></code> directory, to show how plugins should be configured.
It adds a top-level menu item, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Chopper</span></code>, that has a couple of
sub-menu items to perform data analysis on the example file,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chopper.nxs</span></code>, which is also distributed with NeXpy.</p>
<p>Here is the structure of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chopper_plugin</span></code> package:</p>

<p>This is sufficient to install the plugin using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pip</span></code> and make it
discoverable by NeXpy through <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nexpy.plugins</span></code> entry point. If the
plugin is embedded within a larger package, adjust the entry point so
that it points to the sub-directory containing the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__init__.py</span></code> file
that defines the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">plugin_menu</span></code> function. For example, if the plugin
modules are contained within the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">plugins</span></code> sub-directory of
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mypackage</span></code>, add the following entry point:</p>

<p>The actions define the menu text and the function that gets called when
it is selected. In the example, they are contained within the package as
two files, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">get_ei.py</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">convert_qe.py</span></code>, but they could also be
in a separately installed package in the Python path.</p>
<p>These files should open a dialog box and perform the required
operations, after which the results can either be saved to a new NeXus
file or saved as modifications to an existing tree item.</p>
<p>For example, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">get_ei.py</span></code> reads the monitor spectra contained within
the currently selected node on the tree, which should have been
previously loaded. It then calculates the difference between the peak
positions of the two spectra, calculates the incident energy, which is
updated in both the dialog box and, if the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Save</span></code> button is pressed,
in the loaded NeXus tree, ready for subsequent analysis.</p>
<p>In the simplest cases, no knowledge of PyQt is required. In the example
below, a grid defines a set of parameters, functions to read those
parameters from the PySide text boxes (here, they are decorated with
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&#64;property</span></code>, which means that the function can be called without an
argument), a couple of buttons to activate different parts of the
analysis, and finally the functions themselves:</p>
