        .. rubric::  Implementation of canSAS standard in NeXus
        
        This application definition is an implementation of the canSAS
        standard for storing both one-dimensional and multi-dimensional 
        *reduced* small-angle scattering data.

        * NXcanSAS is for reduced SAS data and metadata to be stored together in one file.
        * *Reduced* SAS data consists of :math:`I(\vec{Q})` or :math:`I(|\vec{Q}|)`
        * External file links are not to be used for the reduced data. 
        * A good practice/practise is, at least, to include a reference to how the data was acquired and processed.  Yet this is not a requirement.
        * There is no need for NXcanSAS to refer to any raw data.

        The canSAS data format has a structure similar to NeXus, not identical.
        To allow canSAS data to be expressed in NeXus, yet identifiable
        by the canSAS standard, an additional group attribute ``canSAS_class``
        was introduced.  Here is the mapping of some common groups.
        
        ===============  ============  ==========================
        group (*)        NX_class      canSAS_class

        ===============  ============  ==========================
        
        (*) The name of each group is a suggestion,
        not a fixed requirement and is chosen as fits each data file.  
        See the section on defining
        :ref:`NXDL group and field names &lt;RegExpName&gt;`.
        
        Refer to the NeXus Coordinate System drawing (:ref:`Design-CoordinateSystem`)
        for choice and direction of :math:`x`, :math:`y`, and :math:`z` axes.

            In special cases, when a standard deviation cannot possibly be used,

            The *resolutions* field will have the same *shape* (dimensions)
            as the Q field.
            
            Generally, this is the principal resolution of each :math:`Q`.
            Names the data object (in this SASdata group) that provides the 
            :math:`Q` resolution to be used for data analysis.  Such as::
            
               @resolutions="Qdev"
            
            To specify two-dimensional resolution for slit-smearing geometry, 
            such as (*dQw*, *dQl*), use a string array, such as::
            
               @resolutions="dQw", "dQl"
            
            There may also be a subdirectory (optional) with constituent 
            components.
            
            This pattern will demonstrate how to introduce further as-yet 
            unanticipated terms related to the data.

            By default, the values of the resolutions data object are assumed to be
            one standard deviation of any function used to approximate the 
            resolution function. This equates to the width of the gaussian 
            distribution if a Gaussian is chosen.  See the ``@resolutions_description``
            attribute.
            
            .. note:: To report uncertainty in reported :math:`Q` values, 
               use the ``@uncertainties`` attribute.  It is possible for both
               ``@resolutions`` and ``uncertainties`` to be reported.

            (optional) 
            Generally, this describes the :math:`Q` ``@resolutions`` data object.
            By default, the value is assumed to be "Gaussian".  These are
            suggestions:
            
            * Gaussian
            * Lorentzian
            * Square :
              note that the full width of the square would be ~2.9 times 
              the standard deviation specified in the vector
            * Triangular
            * Sawtooth-outward : vertical edge pointing to larger Q
            * Sawtooth-inward vertical edge pointing to smaller Q
            * Bin : range of values contributing
              (for example, when 2-D detector data have been reduced 
              to a 1-D :math:`I(|Q|)` dataset)
            
            For other meanings, it may be necessary to provide further details
            such as the function used to assess the resolution.
            In such cases, use additional datasets or a :ref:`NXnote` subgroup
            to include that detail.

          The intensity may be represented in one of these forms:

          differential cross-section
          per unit volume per unit solid angle (such as: 1/cm/sr or 1/m/sr)

          differential cross-section
          per unit atom per unit solid angle (such as: cm^2 or m^2)
          
          **arbitrary units**: :math:`I(Q)`
          usually a ratio of two detectors 
          but units are meaningless (such as: a.u. or counts)
          
          This presents a few problems 
          for analysis software to sort out when reading the data.
          Fortunately, it is possible to analyze the *units* to determine which type of
          intensity is being reported and make choices at the time the file is read. But this is
          an area for consideration and possible improvement.
          
          One problem arises with software that automatically converts data into some canonical
          units used by that software. The software should not convert units between these different
          types of intensity indiscriminately.
          
          A second problem is that when arbitrary units are used, then the set of possible
          analytical results is restricted.  With such units, no meaningful volume fraction 
          or number density can be determined directly from :math:`I(Q)`.
          
          In some cases, it is possible to apply a factor to convert the arbitrary 
          units to an absolute scale.  This should be considered as a possibility 
          of the analysis process.
          
          Where this documentation says *typical units*, it is possible that small-angle
          data may be presented in other units and still be consistent with NeXus.

            The name of the dataset containing the :math:`I` uncertainty

            Generally, this is the estimate of the uncertainty of each :math:`I`.
            Typically the estimated standard deviation.  
            
            *Idev* is the canonical name from the 1D standard.  
            The NXcanSAS standard allows for the name to be described using this attribute.
            Such as::
            
                @uncertainties="Idev"

            Names the field (a.k.a. dataset) that contains a factor
            to multiply ``I``.  By default, this value is unity.
            Should an uncertainty be associated with the scaling factor
            field, the field containing that uncertainty would be 
            designated via the ``uncertainties`` attribute.  
            Such as::
            
              I : NX_NUMBER
                  @uncertainties="Idev" : NX_CHAR
                  @scaling_factor="I_scaling" : NX_CHAR
              Idev : NX_NUMBER

              I_scaling_dev : NX_NUMBER
            
            The exact names for ``I_scaling`` and ``I_scaling_dev`` are not
            defined by NXcanSAS.  The user has the flexibility to use names 
            different than those shown in this example.
