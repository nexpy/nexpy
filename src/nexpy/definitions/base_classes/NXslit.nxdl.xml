			Points to the path of the last element in the geometry chain that places
			this object in space. 
			When followed through that chain is supposed to end at an element depending
			on "." i.e. the origin of the coordinate system.
			If desired the location of the slit can also be described relative to
			an NXbeam, which will allow a simple description of a non-centred slit.

			The reference plane of the slit is orthogonal to the z axis and includes the
			surface that is the entry surface of the slit. The reference point of the slit
			is the centre of the slit opening in the x and y axis on the reference plane.
			The reference point on the z axis is the reference plane.

            Declares which child group contains a path leading 
            to a :ref:`NXdata` group.
            
            It is recommended (as of NIAC2014) to use this attribute
            to help define the path to the default dataset to be plotted.
            See https://www.nexusformat.org/2014_How_to_find_default_data.html
            for a summary of the discussion.

            This is the group recommended for holding the chain of translation
            and rotation operations necessary to position the component within
            the instrument. The dependency chain may however traverse similar groups in
            other component groups.
