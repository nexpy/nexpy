			Points to the path of the last element in the geometry chain that places
			this object in space. 
			When followed through that chain is supposed to end at an element depending
			on "." i.e. the origin of the coordinate system.
			If desired the location of the slit can also be described relative to
			an NXbeam, which will allow a simple description of a non-centred slit.

            Declares which child group contains a path leading 
            to a :ref:`NXdata` group.
            
            It is recommended (as of NIAC2014) to use this attribute
            to help define the path to the default dataset to be plotted.
            See https://www.nexusformat.org/2014_How_to_find_default_data.html
            for a summary of the discussion.
