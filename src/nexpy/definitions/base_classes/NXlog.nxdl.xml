		Information recorded as a function of time.

		Description of information that is recorded against
		time. There are two common use cases for this:

		- When logging data such as temperature during a run
		- When data is taken in streaming mode data acquisition,
		  i.e. just timestamp, value pairs are stored and
		  correlated later in data reduction with other data,


		In both cases, NXlog contains
		the logged or streamed  values and the times at which they were measured as elapsed time since a starting
		time recorded in ISO8601 format. The time units are
		specified in the units attribute. An optional scaling attribute
		can be used to accomodate non standard clocks.


		This method of storing logged data helps to distinguish
		instances in which a variable is a dimension scale of the data, in which case it is stored
		in an :ref:`NXdata` group, and instances in which it is logged during the
		run, when it should be stored in an :ref:`NXlog` group.

		In order to make random access to timestamped data faster there is an optional array pair of
		``cue_timestamp_zero`` and ``cue_index``. The ``cue_timestamp_zero`` will
		contain coarser timestamps than in the time array, say
		every five minutes. The ``cue_index`` will then contain the
		index into the time,value pair of arrays for that
		coarser ``cue_timestamp_zero``.

			and in the units specified in the "units"
			attribute. Please note that absolute
			timestamps under unix are relative to ``1970-01-01T00:00:00.0Z``.

			The scaling_factor, when present, has to be applied to the time values in order
			to arrive at the units specified in the units attribute. The scaling_factor allows
			for arbitrary time units such as ticks of some hardware clock.

            It is recommended (as of NIAC2014) to use this attribute
            to help define the path to the default dataset to be plotted.
